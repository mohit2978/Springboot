## Steps to develop WELCOME-API

1) Create Spring Boot application with below dependencies

		- eureka-discovery-client
		- starter-web
		- devtools
		- actuator
		- zipkin
		- admin-client

2) Configure @EnableDiscoveryClient annotation at boot start class

3) Create RestController with required method

4) Configure below properties in application.yml file


```yml
server:
  port: 1111

spring:
  application:
    name: WELCOME-API

  boot:
    admin:
      client:
        url: http://localhost:9090/     
eureka:
  client:
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka 

management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: '*'
```

we using pom.xml

```xml
# not configuring eureka as our eureka runs on default recomended port!!
spring.application.name=015-rest-api-microservice

server.port=1111

spring.boot.admin.client.url=http://localhost:9090/

management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
```
we not telling eureka server location as using default port number for eureka!!

5) Run the application and check in Eureka Dashboard (It should display in eureka dashboard)

6) Check Admin Server Dashboard (It should display) (we can access application details from here)

	Ex: Beans, loggers, heap dump, thred dump, metrics, mappings etc...


7) Send Request to REST API method

8) Check Zipkin Server UI and click on Run Query button
	(it will display trace-id with details)

when we run this see all 3 servers!!

see status up and running!! se here service in registered !! it tells how many service we have in a project!!

let us see admin server!!

![alt text](image-1.png)

all actuator heap memory ,tack space and other all are present here!!It all do management!!

By admin server you can change log level without restarting server!!


Eureka is service registry tell name ,instance ,url and up or not for application 

Admin use actuators so tell about application ,used for monitoring and managing!!

Let us see zipkin!!

![alt text](image-2.png)

tells how many service in background is working and how much time taken by rest api!!


now next api should communicate via Feignclient!!
