4. To convert the main method to psvm() (public static void main) in Spring Tool Suite (STS) or Eclipse using a shortcut, you can use Content Assist to quickly generate the main method skeleton.

    - Inside your class, type psvm.

    - Press Ctrl + Space. This will trigger the content assist.

    - Select the public static void main(String[] args) suggestion from the list.

    - This will auto-complete the psvm shortcut to the full public static void main(String[] args) method.

5. To enable autosave in Spring Tool Suite (STS) or Eclipse, follow these steps:

    - Go to Window in the top menu.
    - Select Preferences.
    - In the Preferences window, navigate to General → Editors → Autosave.
    - Check the option Automatically save editors before running or Enable autosave for dirty editors.
    - You can also set the interval for autosaving (e.g., every 60 seconds).
    - Click Apply and Close.   

 
    - Spring Tool Suite (STS) and Eclipse don't have a built-in option to autosave on every change (as you type).
